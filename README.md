## Jack Bittiner

The most important thing you need to know about me is that I won the Jackpot on the BBC1 television show Pointless. The second most important thing is that I am a budding junior developer who has recently graduated from Makers Academy.

## Projects

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [Loops & Cats](https://github.com/whatsrupp/loops-and-cats) | This is a live looping web application that allows musicians to record and loop tracks. Please feel free to have a play at: https://loops-and-cats.herokuapp.com/ | Node.js, Web Audio API, WaveSurfer, Jasmine, Heroku |
|[Multiplayer-snake](https://github.com/petewilkins/multiplayer-snake)| This is a real-time multiplayer game of snake. You can play here: https://github.com/petewilkins/multiplayer-snake (it's only fun if you get someone else to connect to the server!)| Node.js, socket.io, Express|
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/jackbittiner/Makersbnb) | This is a clone of Airbnb. I think it's pretty slick and it would no doubt rival them if we put it to market. | Ruby, Rspec, Capybara |
| [Free for Arts Festival](https://github.com/jackbittiner/Festival-Website) | This is currently a work in progress I'm doing on the side of jobhunting. It is an informative website for a festival that my friend is organising. The backbone is there to make it a SPA, I'm just waiting for the content to put in and style! | HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular.js, Heroku (soon) |

## Skills

#### Logic

To be a programmer is to be logical. There is no denying that the theoretical foundations of logic are deeply imbedded in computer science. In my three years of University, Logic was my forte. Having taken modules in Modal Logic, Philosophical Logic and Mathematical Logic and gaining a First in all three I know that I have an ability to solve problems by breaking them down and approaching them entirely with the mighty left side of my brain!

#### Communication / Mentoring

I pride myself on my ability to communicate with ease. Within programming you have to be clear in what you want to portray to others. A lot of the information can be dense and thus needs to be handled in a clear and thoughtful way. This is a talent of mine. During my time at Makers Academy I volunteered to be a mentor for other students in the cohort below me. I was there for coding advice, emotional support and general chit-chats. This was a great opportunity to see if I had a good enough understanding of programming to explain it clearly and succinctly. I passed down nuggets of knowledge much like my mentor did for me. I found it very rewarding to help others in this way.

#### Teamwork

I personally can't imagine anything worse than working alone at home. I love being part of a team and collaborating on projects. Makers Academy highly values pair programming, which I loved as it's great to work through problems together. However I believe I really came into my own when working on larger group projects. My favourite by far was the aforementioned Loops & Cats project. I was in a group with three others and it was by far the most fun I've ever had working. Even when some of the work got technically and conceptually difficult to grasp (such as temporal semantics), we communicated well, knew exactly what had to be done and pulled it out the bag!

## Hobbies and Interests

- I am fascinated by geometric art and have recently taken it up as a hobby. I also like making visual art using the live coding software Cyril!
- I have volunteered at both Glastonbury and Bestival with Oxfam in 2014 and 2015. I also regularly volunteer at Chorlton Arts Festival where I spend my time stewarding at performances.
- I set up and coordinated a monthly club night with two of my friends in Manchester during my time at University. I had a variety of roles including DJ, Promoter and Photographer. A highlight was when I got to DJ at Pangaea, the University of Manchester’s student union night, which is the largest student festival in Europe.
- I wrote multiple articles for the The Mancunion, the largest student newspaper in the United Kingdom. Most of my articles focused on music. I play the guitar and have a love of Disco and World Music.
- I achieved Black Belt in Taekwondo when I was 14 years old.
