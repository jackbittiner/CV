## Projects

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |

|[Multiplayer-snake](https://github.com/petewilkins/multiplayer-snake)| This is a real-time multiplayer game of snake. You can play here: https://github.com/petewilkins/multiplayer-snake (it's only fun if you get someone else to connect to the server!)| Node.js, socket.io, Express|
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/jackbittiner/Makersbnb) | This is a clone of Airbnb. I think it's pretty slick and it would no doubt rival them if we put it to market. | Ruby, Rspec, Capybara |
| [Free for Arts Festival](https://github.com/jackbittiner/Festival-Website) | This is currently a work in progress I'm doing on the side of jobhunting.
