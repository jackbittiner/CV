## Skills

#### Logic

To be a programmer is to be logical. There is no denying that the theoretical foundations of logic are deeply imbedded in computer science. In my three years of University, Logic was my forte. Having taken modules in Modal Logic, Philosophical Logic and Mathematical Logic and gaining a first in all three I know that I have an ability to solve problems by breaking them down and approaching them entirely with the mighty left side of my brain!
