## Jack Bittiner

The most important thing you need to know about me is that I won the Jackpot on the BBC1 television show Pointless. The second most important thing is that I am a budding junior developer who has recently graduated from Makers Academy.

## Skills

#### Logic

To be a programmer is to be logical. There is no denying that the theoretical foundations of logic are deeply imbedded in computer science. In my three years of University, Logic was my forte. Having taken modules in Modal Logic, Philosophical Logic and Mathematical Logic and gaining a first in all three I know that I have an ability to solve problems by breaking them down and approaching them entirely with the mighty left side of my brain!

#### Communication / Mentoring

I pride myself on my ability to communicate with ease. Within programming you have to be clear in what you want to portray to others. A lot of the information can be dense and thus needs to be handled in a clear and thoughtful way. This is a talent of mine. During my time at Makers Academy I volunteered to be a mentor for other students in the cohort below me. I was there for coding advice, emotional support and general chit-chats. This was a great opportunity to see if I had a good enough understanding of programming to explain it clearly and succinctly. I passed down nuggets of knowledge much like my mentor did for me. I found it very rewarding to help others in this way.

## Hobbies and Interests

- I am fascinated by geometric art and have recently taken it up as a hobby.

- I set up and coordinated a monthly club night with two of my friends in Manchester during my time at University. I had a variety of roles including DJ, Promoter and Photographer. A highlight was when I got to DJ at Pangaea, the University of Manchester’s student union night, which is the largest student festival in Europe.
