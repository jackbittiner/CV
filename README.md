## Jack Bittiner

The most important thing you need to know about me is that I won the Jackpot on the BBC1 television show Pointless. The second most important thing is that I am a budding software engineer.

## Experience

### FindMyPast - Full Stack Software Engineer (October 2017 - Present)

Throughout my time at Findmypast I've been on the Money team. The main goal of the team is to drive revenue by optimising the journey from free user to subscriber and retention from there on out. We are a completely autonomous team that have full control of our direction and process. All code was test-driven, paired on, and pushed straight to master. As well as my role as engineer. I took an active role in facilitating sprint reviews and retrospectives.

I was also a member of the Tech Evangelism team. The purpose of this team was to create a good culture in tech at the company. In doing this we organised an external React meet-up in which we wrote our own katas. Now we're currently in the process of organasing an internal company hackathon.
